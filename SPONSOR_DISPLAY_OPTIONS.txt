You have TWO options for displaying sponsors on your homepage!

How It Works:
- Logos scroll automatically across the screen
- Takes 30 seconds to complete one loop
- Duplicates logos for seamless scrolling

✅ ACTIVE on your homepage right now!

OPTION 2: STATIC GRID
======================

Features:

How It Works:
- All 7 logos shown in a grid
- Hover effects (lift up slightly)
- Automatically adjusts columns

- Mobile: 1-2 logos per row

HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN OPTIONS
==============================

If you want to change from carousel to grid:

1. Open index.html
2. Find the sponsor section (around line 45)
3. Replace the carousel HTML with grid HTML

CAROUSEL HTML (Current):
------------------------
<div class="sponsors-carousel">
    <div class="sponsors-track">
        [logos scroll here]
    </div>
</div>

GRID HTML (Alternative):
-----------------------
<div class="sponsors-grid">
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/pkf-dunedin.png" alt="PKF Dunedin">
    </div>
    [repeat for each sponsor]
</div>

FULL GRID CODE
==============

Copy and paste this to replace the carousel:

<div class="sponsors-grid">
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/pkf-dunedin.png" alt="PKF Dunedin">
    </div>
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/qpower.png" alt="Q Power">
    </div>
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/speights-ale-house.png" alt="Speight's Ale House">
    </div>
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/andrew-haulage.png" alt="Andrew Haulage">
    </div>
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/freds-fencing.png" alt="Fred's Fencing">
    </div>
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/new-world.png" alt="New World">
    </div>
    <div class="sponsor-logo">
        <img src="images/sponsors/paladin.png" alt="Paladin">
    </div>
</div>

CUSTOMIZING THE CAROUSEL
=========================

Want to change carousel speed?

In styles.css, find:
    animation: scroll 30s linear infinite;

Change the number:
- 20s = Faster scrolling
- 40s = Slower scrolling
- 30s = Current speed (recommended)

VISUAL COMPARISON
=================

CAROUSEL:
[Logo1] → [Logo2] → [Logo3] → [Logo4] → ...
Continuously moving, loops back to start

GRID:
[Logo1]  [Logo2]  [Logo3]  [Logo4]
[Logo5]  [Logo6]  [Logo7]
All visible at once, static

MOBILE BEHAVIOR
===============

CAROUSEL on Mobile:
- Scrolls faster (20s instead of 30s)
- Smaller logo boxes
- Still smooth and professional

GRID on Mobile:
- Shows 1-2 logos per row
- All logos stack vertically
- Easy to scroll through

Both work great on mobile!

RECOMMENDATION
==============

We recommend the CAROUSEL (current setup) because:

✅ More engaging and modern
✅ Keeps all sponsors visible longer
✅ Creates visual interest
✅ Professional appearance
✅ Users notice it more
✅ Sponsors get more exposure

But if you prefer static display, the grid option is available!

ADDING MORE SPONSORS
====================

For Carousel:
1. Add logo to images/sponsors/
2. Add TWO copies to the carousel:
   - One in first set
   - One in duplicate set (for loop)

For Grid:
1. Add logo to images/sponsors/
2. Add ONE div to the grid
3. Grid auto-adjusts layout

Both support unlimited sponsors!

TESTING
=======

To test locally:
1. Open index.html in browser
2. Watch carousel scroll
3. Hover to pause
4. Check mobile view (browser dev tools)

WHICH SHOULD I USE?
===================

Use CAROUSEL if:
✅ You want modern, dynamic look
✅ You want to draw attention
✅ You have 5+ sponsors
✅ You want professional appearance

Use GRID if:
✅ You prefer traditional layout
✅ Users prefer non-moving content
✅ You want simple design
✅ You have 3-4 sponsors only

CURRENT STATUS
==============

Your homepage currently uses: AUTO-SCROLLING CAROUSEL ✅

Features enabled:
✅ 30-second loop
✅ Hover to pause
✅ Smooth animation
✅ Mobile-optimized
✅ All 7 sponsors displayed

Ready to go live!
